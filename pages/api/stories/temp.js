const story = "<p>             (This article is copied from The New York Times for UX/UI             demonstration purposes.)           </p>           <p>             The Trump administration and Pfizer are close to a deal under which             the pharmaceutical company would bolster supply of its coronavirus             vaccine for the United States by at least tens of millions of doses             next year in exchange for a government directive giving it better             access to manufacturing supplies, people familiar with the             discussions said.           </p>            <p>             An agreement, which could be announced as early as Wednesday, would             help the United States at least partly offset a looming vaccine             shortage that could leave as many as 110 million adult Americans             uncovered in the first half of 2021.           </p>            <p>             So far, only two pharmaceutical companies — Pfizer and Moderna —             have won federal authorization for emergency distribution of             Covid-19 vaccines, and most of what they are capable of producing             for the next six months has already been allocated through contracts             with the United States and other governments.           </p>            <p>             In the negotiations, the government is asking for 100 million             additional doses from Pfizer from April through June. The company             has signaled that it should be able to produce at least 70 million,             and perhaps more, if it can get more access to supplies and raw             materials.           </p>            <Adbox image_url='https://picsum.photos/700/500' height='30vh' />            <p>             To help Pfizer, the deal calls for the government to invoke the             Defense Production Act to give the company better access to roughly             nine specialized products it needs to make the vaccine. One person             familiar with the list said it included lipids, the oily molecules             in which the genetic material that is used in both the Moderna and             Pfizer vaccines is encased.           </p>            <p>             Pfizer first started asking for the government’s help in obtaining             supplies as early as September and has been unhappy about the lack             of response, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.           </p>            <p>             Moderna and other companies that worked more closely than Pfizer             with the administration through its Operation Warp Speed to develop             their vaccines already receive favored treatment from suppliers,             putting Pfizer at a disadvantage. That includes two companies —             Sanofi and Novavax — that have yet to begin large-scale clinical             trials in the United States.           </p>            <p>             Pfizer and the administration have been negotiating for more doses             from Pfizer for more than a month. But a host of other issues have             stood in the way of a deal, including Pfizer’s commitments to other             nations that moved faster than the United States to lock in a big             supply, according to people familiar with the situation.           </p>            <p>             Pfizer already has a federal contract, signed in July, to deliver             100 million doses of its vaccine by the end of March. Moderna has             the same agreement, and has also pledged to sell the government 100             million more doses in the second quarter of the year, from the start             of April to the end of June.

(Moderna’s vaccine is now restricted to those 18 and over, and             Pfizer’s is limited to those 16 and over.)           </p>            <p>             If Pfizer provides another 100 million doses, that would leave about             60 million eligible Americans uncovered in the first half of the             year. Other producers could also cover the shortfall should their             vaccines prove successful.           </p>           <p>             It is not clear how many more doses Pfizer can quickly produce even             if the administration uses the Defense Production Act to clear away             supply obstacles. One person familiar with the situation said the             firm may only be able to deliver 70 million by the end of June, even             with better access to supplies.           </p>            <p>             Had the government agreed to prioritize its supply needs earlier,             one person familiar with Pfizer’s situation said, the company might             be better positioned now to fully meet the demands. Documents             reviewed by The Times showed that Pfizer officials began asking Gen.             Gustave F. Perna, the chief operating officer of Operation Warp             Speed, in September for help with supplies and brought up the issue             repeatedly in weekly meetings.           </p>            <p>             A senior Trump administration official said the government was             unwilling to intervene because Pfizer refused to promise that it             would use those materials to produce vaccines solely for Americans.           </p>            <p>             “It’s our obligation under that type of priority rating to make sure             that assets are used only for U.S. sales or production,” the             official said, “and they weren’t willing to do that.”           </p>            <Adbox image_url='https://picsum.photos/600/1200' height='78vh' />            <p>             People knowledgeable about the talks said General Perna had raised a             different concern with Pfizer, saying the government wanted to             protect its investment in the other companies under Warp Speed’s             umbrella, so it did not want to grant Pfizer the same priority with             supplies.           </p>"
